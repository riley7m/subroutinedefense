**Total QC from ALL Achievements (if fully completed)**: **~1,731,850 QC**

**Time Required**: 2-6 years of active play at 4x speed 24/7

---

## 📈 **Total Free QC Earning Potential**

### **Short Term (1-2 months)**
- Milestones Tier 1-3 (free): ~8,000 QC
- Early achievements (tiers 1-5): ~10,000 QC
- **Total**: ~18,000 QC

### **Medium Term (6-12 months)**
- Milestones Tier 1-7 (free): ~25,000 QC
- Mid-tier achievements: ~50,000 QC
- **Total**: ~75,000 QC

### **Long Term (2+ years)**
- All milestones (free): ~35,860 QC
- All achievements: ~1,731,850 QC
- **Total**: **~1,767,710 QC** (theoretical maximum)

---

## 💎 **Fragment Economy Analysis**

### **Fragment Earning Rates (Estimated)**
Assuming:
- 4x game speed
- 30 second waves
- 11,520 waves per day
- Milestone rewards provide most fragments early game

**Milestone Fragments (Tier 1)**:
- Free track: 22,500 Fragments
- Paid track: 27,500 Fragments
- **Total**: 50,000 Fragments per tier

**All 10 Tiers**: ~575,000 Fragments (with scaling)

**Achievement Fragments**: Not tracked, but players earn fragments from:
- Wave completion rewards
- Boss kills
- Achievements give QC, not fragments directly

---

### **Fragment Costs (Where are they spent?)**

Based on typical idle/tower defense games:
- **Tier Unlocks**: 10,000-100,000+ Fragments per tier
- **Permanent Upgrades**: 5,000-50,000 Fragments each
- **Other Systems**: TBD (need to review fragment sinks)

**Current Fragment Sinks**: ⚠️ **NOT AUDITED YET**
- Need to check TierManager.gd fragment costs
- Need to check if fragments unlock anything else

---

## 🎯 **QC/Fragment Value Proposition**

### **Conversion Rates**
- **1 QC = 50 Fragments**
- **1 USD = ~101-180 QC** (depending on pack)
- **1 USD = ~5,050-9,000 Fragments** (via QC conversion)

### **Fragment Bundle Pricing (via Real Money)**
| Fragments | QC Cost | USD (Starter) | USD (Whale) |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 5,000 | 100 | ~$0.99 | ~$0.56 |
| 50,000 | 1,000 | ~$9.90 | ~$5.56 |
| 500,000 | 10,000 | ~$99.00 | ~$55.56 |

**Example**: To buy 500,000 fragments:
- Direct QC: 10,000 QC
- Via Starter pack ($0.99): Requires 100 packs = **$99.00**
- Via Whale pack ($99.99): Requires 1 pack = **$99.99**

---

## ⚖️ **Balance Assessment**

### **QC Earning vs Spending**

**If player earns all free QC (1.77M QC over 2+ years):**
- Can buy: **35,400,000 Fragments** (1.77M × 50)
- Can buy: All lab slots (21,000 QC) + 1.75M QC remaining
- Can buy: Thousands of hours of lab rush

**If player only plays 6 months (75K QC):**
- Can buy: **3,750,000 Fragments**
- Can buy: All lab slots (21K QC) + 54K QC remaining
- Can buy: ~2,160 hours of lab rush (90 days)

### **Paid vs Free Gap**

**Battle Pass (Paid Milestones)**:
- Cost: ~$4.99-$13.99 per tier
- Gain: +2,750 QC per tier (Tier 1)
- **ROI**: $4.99 → 2,750 QC (551 QC/$) vs buying QC directly (101-180 QC/$)
- **Battle pass is 3-5x better value than QC packs!**

---

## 🚨 **Potential Issues**

### **1. Fragment Pricing Too High?**
At 1 QC = 50 Fragments:
- 500,000 Fragments = 10,000 QC = **$99.99** (whale pack)
- Is 500K fragments worth $100? Need to audit fragment costs!

### **2. Lab Slots Too Cheap?**
- All 3 lab slots = 21,000 QC
- Via whale pack ($99.99) = 18,000 QC (**not enough!**)
- Need $100-$200 of QC to unlock all lab slots
- **Seems reasonable for a permanent upgrade**

### **3. Lab Rush Economics**
- 1 hour = 25 QC = ~$0.25 (via whale pack)
- 24 hours = 600 QC = ~$6.00
- **Very expensive for time skip!** May discourage usage

### **4. Free QC is VERY Generous**
- Free players can earn 1.77M QC over 2+ years
- This is **97x** more than the whale pack (18K QC)
- **May reduce incentive to buy QC packs**
- Consider: Are achievements too generous?

---

## 💡 **Recommendations**

### **Option A: Reduce Free QC**
- Cut achievement rewards by 50-75%
- Total free QC: ~500K instead of 1.77M
- Still generous, but creates more incentive to buy

### **Option B: Increase Fragment Costs**
- If fragments are too cheap, increase fragment costs 2-5x
- Makes QC→Fragment conversion more valuable
- Encourages QC purchases

### **Option C: Add More QC Sinks**
- Create exclusive QC-only items
- Seasonal events requiring QC
- Cosmetics, skins, special data disks

### **Option D: Keep Current Balance (Generous F2P)**
- Accept that free players get tons of QC
- Monetize via battle pass ($5-13/tier)
- Rely on convenience (lab rush, fragments) for whales

---

## 📋 **TODO: Fragment Sink Audit**

**NEED TO CHECK**:
1. How many fragments to unlock each tier? (TierManager.gd)
2. How many fragments for permanent upgrades?
3. Are there other fragment sinks?
4. What's the typical fragment earning rate per hour?

**Once audited, update this section with**:
- Total fragments needed for full progression
- Fragment earning rate at various progression stages
- Time to earn fragments vs QC cost comparison

---

## 🎮 **Player Spending Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: F2P Player (No Money)**
- Earns QC from free milestones + achievements
- Can get ALL lab slots in ~6-12 months
- Can buy millions of fragments over time
- **No pressure to spend, very F2P friendly**

### **Scenario 2: Dolphin ($50-100 total)**
- Buys battle pass for 2-3 tiers ($10-30)
- Buys Remove Ads ($7.99)
- Buys Double Economy ($9.99)
- Maybe buys 1 QC pack ($4.99-$9.99)
- **Total**: ~$50-60 for huge QOL improvements

### **Scenario 3: Whale ($200+)**
- Buys all battle passes ($50-130)
- Buys both IAPs ($17.98)
- Buys multiple QC packs ($50-200)
- Uses QC for lab rush, fragments, lab slots
- **Total**: $200-400+ over 1-2 years

---

## 🔮 **Projected Revenue Model**

**Assumptions**:
- 100,000 players
- 90% F2P ($0)
- 8% Dolphins ($50 avg)
- 2% Whales ($250 avg)

**Revenue**:
- F2P: 90,000 × $0 = $0
- Dolphins: 8,000 × $50 = **$400,000**
- Whales: 2,000 × $250 = **$500,000**
- **Total**: **$900,000** from 100K players

**ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: $9.00
**ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: $90.00
